⚡ React App Workflow (When You Run npm run dev)

When you start your React app, the flow is like this:

🧩 1. You run the command
npm run dev

👉 This starts the Vite development server.
Vite loads your main HTML file and connects your React code to the browser.

📄 2. Vite loads index.html

File path:

project-folder/
└── index.html


This is the main entry HTML file of your app.

It contains a <div id="root"></div> where React will inject your app.




👉 The script here (main.jsx) is the first JavaScript file that runs.

⚙️ 3. main.jsx runs

This is the starting point of your React app.
It connects the React code with the HTML file.


✅ What happens here:

- React finds the <div id="root"> in index.html.
- React creates a root using ReactDOM.createRoot().
- It renders the App component inside that <div>.

🧠 4. App.jsx runs

This is your main React component, which contains your UI (and imports other components).


The output of this file (the UI) is what you see on the browser screen.

🔁 5. Components, State & Props Work

When you interact with the app (buttons, inputs, etc.):

React updates state.

Re-renders the Virtual DOM.

Updates only changed parts in the Real DOM.

📊 In Short — File Execution Order
Step	File Name	Purpose
1	index.html	Entry HTML file — contains <div id="root">
2	main.jsx	Connects React to HTML, renders <App />
3	App.jsx	Main component (UI of your app)
4	Other Components	Imported inside App (like Header, Footer, etc.)

✅ Summary:
When you run your React app:
index.html → main.jsx → App.jsx → other components
When you run your React app:
index.html → main.jsx → App.jsx → other components
