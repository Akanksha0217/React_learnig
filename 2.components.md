âš¡ What are Components in React?

A component is a small, reusable piece of code that defines how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave.

You can think of components like building blocks of a React app â€” each component handles its own structure, styling, and logic.

ðŸ§© Example:
```
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, Akanksha!</h1>;
}
```

Here, Welcome is a React component that displays a message.

You can reuse this component anywhere in your app, like:

<Welcome />

ðŸ”¹ Why Components?

Reusable (use same component in many places)

Easy to manage and debug

Makes big apps modular and organized

ðŸ”¹ Types of Components
Type	Description	Example
1. Functional Component	A simple JavaScript function that returns JSX. (Most commonly used today)	jsx function Hello() { return <h1>Hi!</h1>; }
2. Class Component	Uses ES6 classes and lifecycle methods. (Older method)	jsx class Hello extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hi!</h1>; } }

ðŸ”¹ Example of Using Multiple Components
```function Header() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>;
}

function Footer() {
  return <p>Â© 2025 Akanksha</p>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <p>This is the main content.</p>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}
```

Here:
- Header, Footer, and App are all components.
- App uses other components â†’ just like building blocks.
