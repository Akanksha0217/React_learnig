## 📌 What are Lists in React?
- In React, lists are used to display multiple elements dynamically using JavaScript arrays.
- 👉 We usually use the map() method to render lists.

## 📌 What are Keys?
- Keys are special attributes used by React to identify list items uniquely.
- 👉 Keys help React update UI efficiently.

## 📌 Why Keys are Important?
Keys help React:
 - Identify elements
 - Improve performance
 - Avoid unnecessary re-rendering

## 📌 Index as Key (When to Use?)
- Acceptable for static lists
- Not recommended for dynamic lists

## 📌 Key Points
- Lists are rendered using map()
- Keys must be unique
- Avoid using index for dynamic lists
- Keys improve performance
