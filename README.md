# 🚀 React Learning Repository

Welcome to my **React Learning Repository**!  
This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and notes I’ve created while learning **React.js** — a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
---

## 📚 About React
**React.js** is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast, interactive, and reusable UI components.  
In this repository, I explore React concepts like:
- Components & JSX  
- Props and State  
- useState & useEffect Hooks  
- React Router  
- Event Handling  
- Forms & Controlled Components  
- API Integration with Fetch/Axios  
- Conditional Rendering  
- Lists and Keys  
- Context API & Prop Drilling  
- Lifecycle Methods  

---

## 🧠 My Learning Goals
- Understand core React concepts deeply  
- Build small projects to strengthen my learning  
- Create a few mini React apps and publish them online using **Netlify** or **Vercel**  
- Learn modern React tools (React Bootstrap, React Router, Context API)
