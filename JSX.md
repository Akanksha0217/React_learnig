## 📌 What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
It allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript in React.

### JSX makes React code:
- Easier to read
- Easier to write
- More similar to HTML
👉 JSX is not HTML, but it looks very similar.

## 📌 JSX vs HTML
| JSX                    | HTML             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| className              | class            |
| camelCase              | lowercase        |
| JavaScript allowed     | Not allowed      |
| Must return one parent | Multiple allowed |

## 📌 JSX Compilation
JSX is converted into JavaScript by Babel before running in browser.
👉 Browser does not understand JSX directly

## 📌 Key Points to Remember
- JSX looks like HTML but is JavaScript
- JSX improves readability
- {} is used to write JavaScript inside JSX
- JSX must have one parent element
