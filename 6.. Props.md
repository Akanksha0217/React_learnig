## 📌 What are Props?

Props stand for Properties.
Props are used to pass data from one component to another.

👉 Props are read-only (cannot be changed).

## 📌 Why Props are Needed?

Props make components:
- Reusable
- Dynamic
- Easy to maintain
Example: Same component with different data

## 📌 Props vs State
| Props                 | State                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Passed from parent    | Managed inside component |
| Read-only             | Can be changed           |
| Used for data sharing | Used for dynamic data    |

## 📌 Common Mistakes
- Modifying props ❌
- Forgetting {} for numbers/booleans ❌
- Wrong prop name ❌
