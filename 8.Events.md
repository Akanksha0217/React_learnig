## 📌 What are Events?
Events are actions performed by the user, such as:
- Clicking a button
- Typing in input
- Submitting a form
- Moving mouse

React handles events using camelCase syntax.

## 📌 Common React Events
| Event       | Description  |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| onClick     | Mouse click  |
| onChange    | Input change |
| onSubmit    | Form submit  |
| onMouseOver | Mouse hover  |
| onKeyDown   | Key press    |


## React Events vs HTML Events
| React      | HTML        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| onClick    | onclick     |
| camelCase  | lowercase   |
| JSX syntax | HTML syntax |

## 📌 Key Points
- React events use camelCase
- Use {} for event handlers
- Use e.preventDefault() for forms
- Do not call function directly in JSX
