## 📌 What is State?
State is a built-in object in React that is used to store and manage data that can change over time.
👉 When state changes, the component re-renders automatically.

## 📌 Why State is Needed?
- State is used when data:
- Changes on user interaction
- Depends on time or events
- Needs to update UI dynamically

## 📌 State vs Props
| State                    | Props              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Managed inside component | Passed from parent |
| Can be changed           | Read-only          |
| Dynamic                  | Static             |

## 📌 When to Use State?
Use state when:
- UI needs to update
- Data changes frequently
- User interaction is involved

Do NOT use state for:
- Static data
- Props data

## 📌 Common Mistakes
- Modifying state directly ❌
- Forgetting to import useState ❌
- Using state when props are enough ❌
